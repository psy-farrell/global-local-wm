Code for running the simulations from Farrell et al., "A test of interference versus decay in complex span: Varying distraction within lists". Much of this code has been published elsewhere, and the main additions here are design and analysis scripts for the experiments reported in Farrell et al. 

The scripts that are called to run the simulations are TBRS.m and SOBCS.m for the respective models. Given this perform simulations across a factorial grid of parameter vectors, they take quite a while to run (12+ hours). The analyseGrid*.m scripts take the simulation outputs and turn them in to graphs; those scripts also give some information about the columns in the data files generated by the simulations.
